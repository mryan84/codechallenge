1. Create a NodeJS Server that has 2 endpoints. GetMany should return the entire list of fake products. 
GetSingle should accept an ID, and return just that 1 product. 

// part 1 is done

// npm start from root to run server, listens on http://localhost:8080/

// example usage of GetMany - http://localhost:8080/GetMany

// example usage of GetSingle (pass id, which looks up _id within json) - http://localhost:8080/GetSingle?id=5c58693b2f3b8ac746a18f85

2. Create an SPA which wires up the static HTML given in the repo (You can use (or not) any framework you are comfortable with).

// in progress
